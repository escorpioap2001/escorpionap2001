## FEATURED PROJECTS üåü

**Web Development:**

- [TF_2C](https://github.com/escorpioap2001/TF_2C): This web project is based on a detailed software architecture, developed with the Spring Boot ecosystem to create robust and scalable APIs for the management of bicycles and atmospheric conditions from a city council. The design allowed for its independent execution or in a Kubernetes environment, with clear documentation on how to configure and launch the application in both environments (local and cloud).

- [TFM](https://github.com/escorpioap2001/TFM): This project involved the simulation of a web platform and the creation of a mobile application for sharing recipes among university students, with the aim of facilitating cooking, one of their common problems. The web was developed with Angular, while the services and information storage were implemented using a Java factory and Firebase. The mobile application was developed using React Native Expo.

**Video Games & Multimedia:**

- [TFG](https://github.com/escorpioap2001/TFG): This final degree project consists of the development on Unity of a video game where an intelligent module capable of generating personalized endings according to the user's play style (ACHIEVER / EXPLORER / KILLER / SOCIALIZER) is integrated.
